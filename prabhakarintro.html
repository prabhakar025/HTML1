    <pre>
Hello, my name is Prabhakar Kumar. I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Sharda University, Greater Noida, and I completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Patliputra University, Patna, with 74%.
I have a strong interest in technology and the IT sector, especially in areas like software development, web development, algorithms, and cloud computing.
I am also preparing for GATE 2026, and I have co-authored a research paper on Serverless Computing using AI in VANET, which helped me gain insight into modern technologies and academic research.
I am always eager to learn new skills and contribute to innovative projects.
